This is an implementation of a simple RISC-V processor without any speculative elements. On this processor you can run some C-Programs without dynamic memory allocation. To do this
you need the RISC-V toolchain from https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.

Until now the following things have been implemented:

1. RISC-V Integer 32 bit and 16 bit instructions (keep this in regard if you compile C programs)
2.
